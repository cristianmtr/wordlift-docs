Automatic Summarization
===============
WordLift uses state of the art `Natural Language Processing <https://wordlift.io/blog/en/entity/natural-language-processing/>`_ to summarize the content that you write. You can use the summarization for writing the meta description, for promoting your article on social networks and a lot more! 


.. note::

Automatic Text Summarization is available on all Business and Enterprises licenses. `Contact our sales team <https://wordlift.io/contact-us/>`_ to upgrade your subscription.

WordLift uses the summarized content for the description property of schema `(schema:description) <https://schema.org/description>`_ . This is also used in `WordLift’s context cards <https://wordlift.io/blog/en/entity/context-card/>`_ .

Here is how it works: first of all make sure that excerpts are visible in your WordPress installation. Excerpts are used in WordPress to add summaries of your content. WordLift will generate the summary when you hit the Refresh button. By clicking on the Use button you will be able to edit the provided summary and save it as an excerpt for your blog post.
